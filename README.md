# quad_logs

All quadcopter logs that were collected during the Bachelor thesis "Modeling and Control of Quadcopters in Ground Effect using
Physics Informed Machine Learning" by Aurel X. Appius are uploaded here and openly accessible to anyone.

The data stored in the CSV files are formatted in the following way:
